        <ul>
          <li><strong><u>Info</u></strong><br>Augusta Ada King, countess of Lovelace (December 10, 1815 – November 27, 1852)</li><br>
          <li><strong><u>Life</u></strong><br>Ada was an only child of a poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron. Her father died when she was 8 years old. In 1835 she married William King and they had three children together; Byron, Anne Isabella, and Ralph Gordon. In 1838 she became a countess of Lovelace. Her mother promoted her skills in  mathematics and logics to prevent her going "insane" like her father.  </li><br>
          <li><strong><u>Accomplishments</u></strong><br>Ada's mathematical skills began to emerge when she was seventeen. Her one of the best known accomplishments is the work she did for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. This work is simply known as 'Notes'. She noticed that the machine has abilities beyond pure calculation and was the first one to publish an algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. The algorithm included such things as a program to compute Bernoulli numbers. That is why she is often regarded as a first computer programmer. Ada also noted the potential of Artificial Intelligence by such machines.   </li><br>
          <li><strong><u>Death</u></strong><br>Ada Lovelace died at the age of 36 in 1852 from uterine cancer.</li>
